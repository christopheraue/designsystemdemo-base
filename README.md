# Design System Demo Base App

A simple app having three components:

A `list` containing 5 instances of `list-item` which in turn include a `button`. Clicking the button toggles a selection state for the list item.

## Building the App

`yarn build` will build the js bundle and place it in `public/`. Open `public/index.html` in a browser to have a look at the app.

## Testing the App

`yarn test` runs jest with a dummy test for the `button` component.
